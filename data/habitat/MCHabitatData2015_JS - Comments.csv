Summer Camp's creek exclosure fence begins at about the same location as survey reach (wood fence). Near bottom of reach, sagebrush have died as aspen shaded them out. By SO5130, the meadow has narrowed. Sagebrush slopes are steeper, and bottom is filling with aspen. At SO5133, steep hill on left bank cuts off floodplain. Hill covered in cobble/small boulders (loose). A lot of down mature aspen as SO numbers increase. At SO5139, large mature aspen fell across stream, breaking/splitting when it hit the right bank. The left bank remains steep and with lots of leaf litter and loose rock; diconnected floodplain. Right bank begins to open up some, and the structures of Summer Camp are visible (along with trash) at the end of the reach."
